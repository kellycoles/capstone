# The Maintenance Log

The Maintenance Log is an app for anyone who owns anything that requires maintenance or repairs. Users can create a list of items organized by category. They can store details, notes, model numbers, and repair manuals for the items, and log all of the maintenance and repairs performed on the items. Users can access maintenance details on one item or all items. User authentication and persistent storage allow multiple users to store, create, read, edit, and delete their lists of items, and their maintenance lists.
